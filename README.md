# Getting Started with Create React App

Find current weather and forecast for your city. Made with React and Redux

## Tools used:
### React 
In this project, I used React because I can create a much better layout, easy control state, and use self-made.

### Redux, React-Redux, Redux Thunk
Redux is used to store, in a state, fetched weather data from Weather API (Link: https://www.weatherapi.com). Redux Thunk is used to dispatch actions asynchronously and resolve each promise that gets returned.

### Styles
As a method for styling, I used styled-components and SASS to make the style process more stabilized.
